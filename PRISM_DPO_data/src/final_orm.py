You are evaluating a multi-stage reasoning process. Below is the model's answer at a specific stage, and the ground truth for comparison.

Stage Description:
- Depth 1 (PROBLEM): Initial problem understanding and intention analysis
- Depth 2 (CAPTION): Image description and visual analysis 
- Depth 3 (REASONING): Logical reasoning and step-by-step analysis
- Depth 4 (OUTPUT): Final answer and conclusion

Current Stage: Depth {depth}

{prompt}

Model's Answer at this stage: {predict}

Ground Truth for this stage: {ground_truth}

Please evaluate how well the model's answer matches the ground truth and addresses the question at this specific stage. Consider:
1. Accuracy: How factually correct is the answer compared to ground truth?
2. Completeness: Does it cover the key points from the ground truth?
3. Relevance: How well does it address the current stage requirements?
4. Clarity: Is the reasoning clear and well-structured?

Rate the answer on a scale from 1 to 5:
1. Completely incorrect or irrelevant compared to ground truth
2. Partially correct but contains significant errors or omissions  
3. Generally correct with minor errors or missing some details
4. Mostly accurate and complete, very close to ground truth
5. Excellent match with ground truth, accurate and comprehensive

Only give your conclusion with a new line. The format should be "Conclusion: [score]".
